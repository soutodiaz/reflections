When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When I want to share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    I rather pull changes manually than having Git do it autommatically because it might distrupt
    the new features I'm working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks is to clone on GitHub amongst other users on GitHub
        I would use it when I want a copy on my GitHub
    Clones - to copy from one repository to another locally or from GitHub to Local pc
    Branches - are extended version of master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    Benefit is that I can update local copy while I have internet access even if I don't want to merge it with my branch.
    After internet access is not available, I still have the capability to merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    It would be kind of difficult to collaborate without Git but not impossible.
    I would try to use a svn.
